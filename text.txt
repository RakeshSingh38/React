// if u are facing error such as
'component' is missing props validation
then 
at the top of the code add
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */

or

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// here Product is a functional component ( change it your component name)
Product.propTypes = {
  product: PropTypes.object.isRequired
};

// add it before export default ....

// tip      this will remove the error -> Delete the .eslintrc.cjs file from the root
Delete the .eslintrc.cjs file from the root directory of the project
